Solarized is a sixteen color palette (eight monotones, eight accent colors)
designed for use with terminal and gui applications. It has several [unique
properties](#features). I designed this colorscheme with both precise
[CIELAB](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lab_color_space) lightness relationships
and a refined set of hues based on fixed color wheel relationships. It has been
tested extensively in real world use on color calibrated displays (as well as
uncalibrated/intentionally miscalibrated displays) and in a variety of lighting
conditions.

***See the [changelog] for what's new in the most recent release.***

Installation
------------

Installation instructions for each version of the colorscheme are included in
the subdirectory README files. Note that for Vim (and possibly for Mutt) you
may want to clone the specific repository (for instance if you are using
Pathogen). See the links at the top of this file.

Font Samples
------------

Solarized has been designed to handle fonts of various weights and retain
readability, from the classic Terminus to the beefy Menlo.
